## Using the App

#### Upon running the app, a table of dogs is populated with personality profiles.  These profiles are used to match a dog from the database with a dog entered by the user.

#### The user can submit a dog by using the survey.  After completing the survey, a number of queries compare the user's answers to each dog in the database and find the closest match.  When a match is found, the user is shown a picture of the dog that best matches their own.
